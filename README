SparkSense is a plugin for Visual Studio 2010 that enables various tooling support and productivity features when using Spark as a View Engine for various MVC frameworks including ASP.NET MVC, FubuMVC, Monorail, OpenRasta to name a few. It also works when using Spark as a stand-alone templating engine in VS2010.

The source code has been moved out of the core Spark library due to key differences in use and applicability and deployment cycles. In addition to providing better visibility for the product, it also takes a dependency on the Visual Studio 2010 SDK which means it cannot be part of the Spark Core primary solution without forcing any developers only interestd in Spark Core to install the SDK. It also also allows those developers who wish to learn about Visual Studio Extensibility without needing to concern themselves with the code base of Spark Core iteself.
